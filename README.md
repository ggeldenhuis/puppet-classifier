What?
=====

An attempt to port https://github.com/binford2k/puppet-classifier to pure Puppet 4 DSL.

This is a node classifier where you can write classification rules that perform boolean matches on
fact data and should a rule match some classes will be included.  Any number of classification
rules can match on a given node and they can all contribute classes.

Different data tiers can contribute rules and it has a way to just add classes statically like
the old `hiera_include()` approach.

Sample Data
-----------

Sticking this in Hiera will create a classification that on RedHat VMs will include the classes `centos::vm` and on the node `node.example.net` it will also include `ntp` in addition.

```
# common.yaml
classifier::extra_classes:
 - sensu
classifier::rules:
  RedHat VMs:
    match: all
    rules:
      - fact: os.family
        operator: ==
        value: RedHat
      - fact: is_virtual
        operator: ==
        value: true
    classes:
      - centos::vm
```

```
# node.example.net.yaml
# remove sensu and install nagios instead, also add extra stuff
classifier::extra_classes:
  - --sensu,nagios
  - client::sysadmins

# adjust the RedHat VMs rule to also have NTP should
# a node match the rule defined in common.yaml
classifier::rules:
  RedHat VMs:
    classes:
      - ntp
```

```
node default {
  include classifier
}
```

The `extra_classes` parameter lets you specify a array of additional classes without having to construct
rules and they are setup with a knockout of `--` so that you can remove lower down results.

At present you can't knockout classes included by rules using a knockout prefix on `extra_classes`, this
os something that's planned

Other classes can access detail about the classification result:

  * $classifier::classification - a array of Hashes with matching Rule names and classes
  * $classifier::classification_classes - just the classes extracted from the classification
  * $classifier::extra_classes - the extra classes resolved from hiera
  * $classifier::classes - the list of classes that will be included


Issues
------

Ideally the fact within a classification would not be limited to facts but rather anything
Hiera knows.  But due to PUP-6054 this does not work in Environment data only in classic
Hiera, so for now the `fact` on a rule has to be a `.` seperated path within the `$facts`
hash.
